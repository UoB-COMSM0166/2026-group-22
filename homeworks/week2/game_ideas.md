## Kirby and Cuphead

### Game Description
Kirby is a colorful platformer where you control Kirby through side-scrolling or 3D stages, jumping, floating, and fighting enemies. The core mechanic is Kirby’s ability to inhale foes and objects, then copy enemy powers to gain new attacks and movement options. Levels focus on simple combat, exploration, and light puzzles, with power-ups encouraging flexible, playful playstyles.

Cuphead is a run-and-gun boss-rush action game with a 1930s cartoon aesthetic, built around fast, pattern-heavy fights. You shoot, dodge, dash, and parry to build special attacks while learning enemy telegraphs and phases. The gameplay emphasizes tight controls, memorization, and precision, with short stages and bosses designed for repeated attempts and mastery.

### Twist
We mainly built the twist of our game based on Kirby and Cuphead：

- Two skills-acquiring system, including cooperation with friends and obtaining skills in store by collecting gold coins.
